# Internship
This report pertains to my internship focused on biomedical image segmentation, a critical area in medical imaging that involves identifying and delineating specific regions within biomedical images. The primary aim of the project was to develop foundational tools and datasets that would serve as training material for artificial intelligence (AI) models. Biomedical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in advancing AI applications in healthcare, such as detecting anomalies, enhancing diagnostics, and improving treatment planning by enabling automated analysis of complex medical images like MRIs, CT scans, and microscopic tissue samples.

Throughout this internship, I gained practical experience in processing medical datasets, implementing different segmentation tecnhiques, and exploring different softwares in order to ascertain their advantages and disadvantages. It is important to note that due to the sensitive nature of the data involved, including CT images derived from actual patients, I am unable to upload or share these images in this report to ensure compliance with confidentiality and data privacy regulations.

This report will provide a comprehensive overview of the methodologies applied, the challenges encountered, and the key outcomes of my work, contributing to the broader goal of implementing biomedical image analysis.

P.S.: The pdf version doesnÂ´t display the preview of certain CT segmentations.
